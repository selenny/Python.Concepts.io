# Purpose: Complete assignment and show basic knowledge each number in assignment.



# 1. Assign an integer to a variable
    # counter = 100
# 2. Assign a string to a variable
    # article = 'magazines'
# 3. Assign a float to a variable
    # myFloat = float(7)
# 4. Use the print fuction and .format() notation to print out the variable you assigned.
    # myFloat = float(70).format()
    # print myFloat
# 5. Use each of these operators +,-,*/+=,=,%
    ''' myvariable = 44+27-1*32/1
        correctBill = correctBill +=20
        newRaise = 4%   '''
# 6. Use of logical operators: and, or, not
    ''' if (age > 18 AND age <=35)
      if (age > 35 OR age < 60)
      if age = True then NOT (age)  '''
# 7. Use of conditional statements: if, elif, else
    ''' var = 100
      if var == 200:
          print var
      elif var == 300:
          print var
      else:
          print "Ok This is the answer your looking for"   '''
# 8. ''' count = 0
         while (count < 9):
             print 'The count is:', count
             count = count + 1
         print "Thank you"   '''
# 9. Use of for loop
    ''' for val in numbers:
             sum = sum + val '''
#10. Create a list and iterate through that list using a for loop to print each item out on a new line
    ''' myList = ['20', '40', '60']
        for elem in myList:
            print elem '''
# 11. Create a tuple and iterate through the list using a for loop
    ''' animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'chicken', 'gorilla']
        for animal in animals:
            print("I have a" + animal + ".") '''
#12. Define a function that returns a string variable
    ''' def square(x):
                y = X * X
                return y
        toSquare = 10
        result = square(toSquare) '''
#13. Call the function you defined above and print the result to the shell
    # print "The result of" + str(toSquare) + "squared is" + str(result)
